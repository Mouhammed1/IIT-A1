        <h3>PERSONAL INFORMATION</h3>
      </div>

      <div class="section1">
        <p>My name is Mouhammed Mardli and I am currently studying Information technology at RMIT through Open universities Australia. My values and beliefs are simple but effective, I believe in hard work and striving for excellence no matter the obstacle.</p>
        <p>My parents migrated to Australia from Lebanon in the 1970s, and to me have been the embodiment of these values. Witnessing this hard work and perseverance has given me the tools I need to flourish in any work condition along with the motivation to better myself through education. As far as education goes, I have completed the HSC in 2010 and was accepted into Macquarie University, however I was not able to continue as I needed to provide an income for my family. Through hard work I was able to place myself in a position which allows me now to reignite my educational journey. I love watching and playing sports, also I am a fanatic NBA fan of the Los Angeles Lakers and the NRL specifically the South Sydney Rabbitohs.</p>

      <h3>INTEREST IN IT</h3>
    </div>

    <div class="section1"
        <p>My interest in technology developed at a young age. I observed the impact that technology has had on society, from the impact it has had on the automotive industry to social media and the internet. Technology has changed the world, along with keeping me intrigued as to how far it can go, as well as how certain things were possible.</p>

        <p>As I mentioned before, my parents were migrants, so their first language was not English. This gave me the responsibility at a young age to be the “IT support” of the household, as I could read and understand English well. I would always be asked to fix a certain family members phone or help them use a computer and even at times the television. I believe this is one of the main reasons technology continued to fascinate me, as I have found that when a person is able to do something that others may not or do a certain thing better than others, it can create motivation in them which can turn their skills into a passion.</p>

        <p>I have worked in the IT industry for three years from 2011 until 2014. I was employed by NSW Health as an IT support analyst providing technical support for various medical databases and applications, Windows, Microsoft office and active directory. I chose to study at RMIT as I would like to return to the IT industry. Since RMIT is a renowned institution for IT, this will allow me to develop all the essential skills and tools that I need to thrive in a variety of IT careers. I will be able to learn and practice these skills all whilst studying from home which can allow me to maintain personal and family responsibilities.</p>

        <p>During my studies I expect to learn the skills I need to succeed in a variety of IT roles. Furthermore, by the time I have completed my studies I expect to be able to understand the concepts and need for certain skills in the IT industry. For example, I expect to learn why developers need to know networking fundamentals and how do the two relate.</p>

      <h3>IDEAL JOB</h3>
      <section>
        <h5>Job Title: Front-end developer </h5>

        <h5>Job Advertisement: <a href="Jobad.pdf" target="_blank">Front-end developer</a> </h5>


        <p>My Ideal job would be a front-end developer. A front-end developer’s role is to make a website or web application functional and interactive for users. They look after most features of a website including what users can interact with. They will also be responsible for the design and implementation of the user interface, including buttons, images and layout. They do all these tasks using technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript and DOM. This is a challenging role as they need to make sure the user can access the websites and apps from a range of different devices, web browsers and operating systems. This position is looking for somebody who has an interest in graphics which tells me that that apart from the technical skills, the applicant could be required to have some creativity skills. These challenges are why I personally find this career appealing. Also implementing something which functions well and can be used by a broad range of users worldwide would be very rewarding. As I have mentioned earlier, I have witnessed technology change the world and to be able to personally contribute to this inspirational industry would be a great achievement.</p>

        <p>This position requires qualifications and experience as the work will be complex and challenging. They require a great understanding of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The position requires using these skills to work on smart TV apps, Android and iOS apps and node.js. As you will most likely be working on a team, having these skills will allow you to be a productive team member who is able to contribute quality work. They ask for several years of experience developing applications using web technologies which tells us that they require a developer who will be able to be productive from day one. Also, knowledge of Angular and TypeScript is desired, however they will train the successful applicant in these skills. Angular is a framework for building web applications that is written in TypeScript, a programming language which adds advantages to JavaScript and is also easy to learn. Another skill they have listed is Git which is an open-source version control system which tells us that there will be teamwork involved in this job. Git allows a team to work on aspects of a project at the same time and will allow changes that each team member makes clear to the rest of the team. From this we know that strong communication and teamwork skills are also required.</p>

        <p>Currently I have many skills that would make me a great addition to many IT roles. Some of these skills are strong communication skills, written skills, great organisation skills, strong problem-solving skills, perseverance and creativity. I completed advanced English for my HSC which gave me the ability to read and write at a solid level and an understanding of how to use the English language in a written or spoken context. I adopted problem solving skills at a young age, as I noted before constantly helping family members with certain devices and continued to grow these skills working in an IT support role. Perseverance and creativity are skills which I have naturally always had growing up, not giving up on certain things and working on solutions conventionally and creatively.</p>

        <p>Through studying this course and completing a Bachelor of Information Technology, I aim to have all the necessary skills needed for this position including HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Also, upon completion I plan to apply for a junior or graduate role in a similar field where I can develop the workforce skills and training needed to be successful and productive in this type of role.  Furthermore, I will pursue industry certifications in Angular and TypeScript to further prepare me for a successful career.</p>

      <h3>PERSONAL PROFILE</h3>
      <section>
        <img src="myersbriggspic.png" alt="Myers-Briggs results" class="image1" height="300px" />
        <img src="learningstyle.png" alt="Learning style test results" class="image2" height="300px" />
        <img src="creativitytest.png" alt="Creativity test results" class="image3" height="300px" />

        <p>These test results give an employer a general insight into the type of person they are looking to hire or allocate to a team. The Myers-Briggs test results indicated that I am of the advocate personality type. As I believe that this is somewhat true about myself, I feel that some of the traits are not completely representative of me. I feel as though my energy is more observant and my nature is more thinking as opposed to feeling. My learning style test returned the result of a visual learner, and I believe that this is accurate to a degree, although I feel like I learn the same by just reading an article or report. Also, my creativity score was a little less than I expected as I see myself being quite creative for example, in high school I was always top of my class in Art. These results are very informative and to some degree accurate, however I strongly believe that a person can make decisions based on circumstance and if they are always looking to improve themselves as a better worker, learner and overall person then all this could change. The questions which I was asked especially for the Myers-Briggs type indicator were very vague. For example, one question asked, “You usually stay calm, even under a lot of pressure”. However, they did not specify what type of pressure this was, was it pressure from work or was it pressure because a close relative or loved one was very sick. Some people may define staying calm differently to another, and even their own definition of staying calm may change if the circumstances change.</p>

        <p>Based on the results of the three tests I believe that I can be a valuable part of any team. The Myers-Briggs results indicates that I can be a great problem solver between others if a problem was to arise. This could be very valuable, and I think that one of these people should be on every team. As team members may have different views on certain aspects of a project, this can cause friction within the team. For example, two team members have an argument, this can cause some problems for the rest of the team and slow down productivity. Also, the creativity test results show that I could creatively come up with a solution to others’ problems, in case there is a fork in the road or if the team gets stuck and can’t come up with a way to start a project, using my creativity I could come up with a different approach and give my thoughts to the rest of the team. Being a visual learner means that I can add to my skills and learn a lot from other team members as I will be watching the way they do things and learn from this.</p>

        <p>When forming a team choosing the right people is critical. There are several factors that could be the difference between a successful team and an unsuccessful one. This could be a very difficult task especially if you don’t know the people personally, so using these three tests can make a great difference. As I mentioned before these tests are not completely accurate and do have their flaws however, these test results are very general and give a general idea of what to expect from a certain person therefore could be a great tool when forming a team.</p>

      <h3>PROJECT IDEA</h3>
      <section>
        <p>A global pandemic forcing lockdowns and restrictions across all continents has most people concerned for their safety and wellbeing. The coronavirus disease has claimed the lives of more than five million people worldwide and over two hundred million cases. I believe developing a tool to help people feel safe and secure would go a long way with the overall morale in society. I have an idea for a tool that I will share with you, which can make some of the uncertain things in these uncertain times feel a little more secure. My idea involves a mobile application which is free for everyday Australians to use, allowing them to navigate through their day whilst avoiding certain places where it is likely to catch the virus. It allows people to plan their daily tasks of shopping for groceries, going to the bank or even going out to the beach while limiting the constant fear of being infected with COVID 19. The application will be implemented as a chatterbot that people can rely on to give accurate insights as to where they will be at risk of being infected.</p>

        <p>Australia has been one of the countries most affected by the COVID 19 virus. Lockdowns and restrictions have been in effect country wide, and as we see the number of cases reduce during these lockdowns, when restrictions are eased the case numbers are soaring. As restrictions in NSW have been lifted this week, the state records its highest daily cases ever at 2,213 with scares that another lockdown is on the way. The ServiceNSW app has a feature which allows people to check-in wherever they go using a QR code, so they can be informed if an outbreak happens, and they can quickly isolate. The feature has had more than 1.1 million check-ins since it launched in September. What if we could use this data to create a mobile application which can provide information when asked about particular locations.</p>

        <p>The application can provide users a way to plan out their daily tasks and activities while limiting the fear of being infected. It can use the data from the QR check-ins of people, and then determine the probability of infections in these places using factors like age, medical history, address, recent oversees travel etc. It could be designed as a mobile application that can launch on the Apple store and Google play store, which users can download for free. Also, a website similar to google that the users could quickly access when they need could be implemented if the application is successful.</p>

        <p>The user can open the application on their mobile and ask a question like “Is it safe to go to Woolworths today?” and the chatterbot will take this question, assess the data and return the results. If there is a high probability of infection at the closest Woolworths, the chatterbot could make suggestions for other stores in the area, giving the user maps and directions. It would give the user an idea or a percentage of the likelihood of being infected at a certain store compared to the usual store where they shop. It could also give the user a brief history about how many people have been recently infected in the store and how many of them were unvaccinated if the user simply asks, “How many COVID cases today?”. The application will also be able to answer a wide range of questions about local cases like how many cases were documented that day and what precautions the user can take to stay safe. It will have speech-to-text and text-to-speech features which will provide user convenience, for example the user is already in the car heading to their local McDonalds and their worried about getting infected, whilst driving they can use the speech-to-text feature and ask “What’s Maccas like today?” the application will then return the results using text-to-speech and suggest certain precautions to take while visiting the restaurant. The user could also set preferences within the application which allows them to see more infectious diseases other than COVID 19, and this feature will be great as even when COVID is gone in the future, the application will stay relevant. It can also use reminders and notifications to remind the user to sanitize or wash their hands after they get back into their car and daily tips to avoid getting sick. Also, if there is a case somewhere they have been recently it will notify the user to isolate and even suggest movies or tv shows to watch and even games to play to keep isolation manageable. The user can also use features like the “Do I have COVID?” feature where the user can ask the question and our chatterbot will go to work, asking the user back some key questions which will assess the need for isolation and what to do next. Another feature the application will have is an “easy reporting” feature, which allows the user to take pictures and automatically report the people who are not following the laws in place to prevent the spread of infection, however this may be somewhat controversial although it would be a great feature.</p>

        <p>This mobile application will be designed using Python and the Kivy framework. Python has been used to design other mobile applications such as Instagram, Facebook, Pinterest and Uber. Python is an advanced and versatile open-source programming language which includes the chatterbot features we desire. Python is a great language to build this application as it is easy to understand, easy to implement and is very reliable. It can be used on any operating system which will be great when assigning a team of programmers to write the code as no specific hardware or software will need to be considered.</p>

        <p>Since our application will be handling a large amount of personal data, Python is perfect as it is secure. This also relates to Kivy and it will allow us to create a great python application that we can run on all platforms. We could also use a framework like BeeWare but have chosen Kivy due to its reputation for reliability. It will be easy to hire a team of developers to create the application as Python is a widely used programming language. Its open-source nature means that we can start our project with no start-up costs and until we have written a program we are happy with, we can then decide on implementation. This also relates to Kivy as its license allows us to use the framework in our own personal or commercial projects.</p>

        <p>This mobile application could be a great tool if used correctly however there are a few factors to consider. There will be a large amount of user data collected in the application which can be a risk of a data breach. Here the issue of privacy will cause somewhat of a large concern for potential investors. Also, this privacy concern may be an issue with users not wanting to use the application anymore. However, for the application to be considered a successful project we need the cause of creation to be fulfilled. I believe that after implementation of this application, if used correctly it could keep the COVID cases low by making users more aware of good hygiene practices. With this achieving our goal of maintaining low COVID cases after restrictions are eased. I believe using the application correctly over a period of time will make users accustomed to the reminders, notifications and tips that the application generates and in turn they will practice these healthy habits, keeping ourselves and society safe from potential threats.</p>
